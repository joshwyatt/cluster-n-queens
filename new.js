//LET'S DO THIS RIGHT

//i need to be able to caluclate the solutions for a given n, passing in a board state.
//if the board state will consist of already attacked squares and which row we are starting at.
//in this way anyone with this algo can be entirely agnostic of what needs doing and we can just
  //pass in args and get what we need.


function boardStateGenerator(n, rowToStartAt){
  var boardState;

  return boardState;
}

function calculateSolutions(n, rowToStartAt){
  var solutions = 0;

  return solutions;
