// n will indicate the number of rows, columns, and queens we will calucate 
// solutions for. A solution consists of a board in which n queens have been placed 
// and none of the are attacking any other one
// This implementation of n-queens is designed to be distributed into multiple processes. At 
// a high level, this countSolutions algorithm is placing a queen on the `top row` of the board 
// (which of course we are simply representing by a binary digit of 0's that is length n) and then 
// recursively calling countSolutions again for the next row, passing in the board state created 
// by having already placed a queen on the first row. What this means, is that by beginning at the 
// first row, we have a single process that calculates all possible solutions.

// In order to distribute the work, the user can decide at which row they would like start making calls 
// to the main algorithm. This implementation will calculate all possible board states up to the 
// requested row, and then make a call to countSolutions for each of these board states.

// For example, consider if n === 4 and we start at the second row (row index of 1). Because there 
// are 4 possible places that a queen could be placed on the first row, countSolutions is called 4 
// times, each passing in a different board state based on where the queen was placed on the first row.
// If we began at the third row (row index 2) then there would be 4 possible plays on the first row
// as well as 4 possible plays at the second row for each of these first 4 plays and therefore 16 
// calls to countSolutions, each beginning at the 3rd row and being passed in the board state for one
// of the 16 possibilities.

// I hope this makes clear that the number of processes invoked is equal to n^rowToStartAtIndex. 
// If n is 4 and we start at row index 0, there is 1 process. If n is 4 and we start at row index 1 
// there are 4 processes etc.
